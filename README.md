<details>
  <summary> 1. Subcategory Revenue Analysis </summary>
 Calculate the quantity of items, sales value & order quantity by each Subcategory in the last 12 months. 

```sql
SELECT 
  FORMAT_DATE('%b %Y', s.ModifiedDate) as period
  ,ps.Name
  ,SUM(s.OrderQty) as qty_item
  ,SUM(s.LineTotal) total_sales
  ,COUNT(DISTINCT s.SalesOrderID) as order_cnt
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as s
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as p
  ON s.ProductID=p.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` as ps

GROUP BY period, ps.Name
ORDER BY period DESC, ps.Name

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

üëâüèª Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the stakeholder team to consider the following:    
‚úîÔ∏è Visits are stable in Q1 2017, while transactions rose and improved the conversion rate from 1.10% to 1.42%.   
‚úîÔ∏è Google has a high number of visits but also a very high bounce rate, while YouTube had the worst engagement (66.73% bounce rate). Reddit had the lowest (28.57%), showing better content relevance.   
‚úîÔ∏è Although the Average Pageviews of Purchase increased by 32% (from 94 to 124), the Average Pageviews of Non-Purchase remain high (from 94 to 124), indicating that customers are struggling to find suitable products and      make purchasing decisions.  
‚úîÔ∏è Add-to-cart rate (28.47% ‚Üí 37.29%) and purchase rate (8.31% ‚Üí 12.64%) steadily improved in Q1 2017, signaling better conversion efficiency.   

üìå Key Takeaways:  
‚úîÔ∏è Conduct surveys or phone calls to understand customers better to improve the landing page.  
‚úîÔ∏è Simplify navigation and optimize the payment process to increase the number of buyers.  
‚úîÔ∏è Create attractive banners and promotional vouchers for products, coupled with solutions for cart abandonment to increase add-to-cart and purchase rates.
