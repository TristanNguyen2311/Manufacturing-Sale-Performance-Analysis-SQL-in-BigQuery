## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process

<details>
  <summary> 1. Traffic & Engagement Analysis</summary>
Measured total visits, page views, and transactions in Q1 2017 to identify key traffic trends and seasonal patterns.

```sql
-- Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb, and March 2017 (order by month)
SELECT 
   format_date("%Y%m", parse_date("%Y%m%d", date)) as month
  ,SUM(totals.visits) as visits
  ,SUM(totals.pageviews) as pageviews
  ,SUM(totals.transactions) as transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN "0101" AND '0331'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
```

Query Result:
| Month  | Visits | Pageviews | Transactions |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 201701 | 64,694 | 257,708   | 713          |

  <summary> 2. Marketing Effectiveness</summary>
Evaluated bounce rates per traffic sources in July 2017 to pinpoint ineffective channels and optimize landing pages.

```sql

SELECT   
  trafficSource.source
  ,SUM(totals.visits) as totals_visits

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

üëâüèª Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the stakeholder team to consider the following:    
‚úîÔ∏è Visits are stable in Q1 2017, while transactions rose and improved the conversion rate from 1.10% to 1.42%.   
‚úîÔ∏è Google has a high number of visits but also a very high bounce rate, while YouTube had the worst engagement (66.73% bounce rate). Reddit had the lowest (28.57%), showing better content relevance.   
‚úîÔ∏è Although the Average Pageviews of Purchase increased by 32% (from 94 to 124), the Average Pageviews of Non-Purchase remain high (from 94 to 124), indicating that customers are struggling to find suitable products and      make purchasing decisions.  
‚úîÔ∏è Add-to-cart rate (28.47% ‚Üí 37.29%) and purchase rate (8.31% ‚Üí 12.64%) steadily improved in Q1 2017, signaling better conversion efficiency.   

üìå Key Takeaways:  
‚úîÔ∏è Conduct surveys or phone calls to understand customers better to improve the landing page.  
‚úîÔ∏è Simplify navigation and optimize the payment process to increase the number of buyers.  
‚úîÔ∏è Create attractive banners and promotional vouchers for products, coupled with solutions for cart abandonment to increase add-to-cart and purchase rates.
