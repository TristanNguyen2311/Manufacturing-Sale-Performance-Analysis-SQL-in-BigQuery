## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process

<details>
  <summary> 1. Subcategory Revenue Analysis </summary>
 Calculate the quantity of items, sales value, and order quantity by each Subcategory in the last 12 months.   

```sql
SELECT 
  FORMAT_DATE('%b %Y', s.ModifiedDate) as period
  ,ps.Name
  ,SUM(s.OrderQty) as qty_item
  ,SUM(s.LineTotal) total_sales
  ,COUNT(DISTINCT s.SalesOrderID) as order_cnt
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` as s
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as p
  ON s.ProductID=p.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` as ps
  ON CAST(p.ProductSubcategoryID as INT) = ps.ProductSubcategoryID
WHERE DATE(s.ModifiedDate) >= (SELECT DATE_SUB(DATE(MAX(ModifiedDate)), INTERVAL 12 MONTH) 
                                    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`)
GROUP BY period, ps.Name
ORDER BY period DESC, ps.Name
```

Query Result:

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations  

üëâüèª Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the stakeholder team to consider the following:    

‚úîÔ∏è Mountain Bikes had the highest revenue ($14,191,949) in the past 12 months, with 12,572 units sold ‚Äî more than three times the number of orders (3,755).    
‚úîÔ∏è Southwest had the highest number of orders from 2011 to 2014 but experienced a sharp decline in order quantity in 2014 (26,682 -> 11,632).   
‚úîÔ∏è The number of pending orders (224), accounting for 10% of total orders, is acceptable. However, specific actions are needed to reduce this rate to 5‚Äì7%.   
 
üìå Key Takeaways:  

‚úîÔ∏è Focus on high-revenue bestsellers and balance inventory levels for each product.    
‚úîÔ∏è Investigate the reasons behind the sharp decline in orders from Southwest, then propose solutions to address the issue.   
‚úîÔ∏è Identify the main reasons for pending orders ‚Äî whether due to system errors, internal issues, or external factors (e.g., unconfirmed orders or missing customer information). In addition, optimize production and logistics processes.
